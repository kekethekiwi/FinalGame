Game Protoype WriteUp

Overall concept:
-Inspired by Little Nightmares but I won't be making my game exactly same as Little Nightmares

Features to implement:
-Character Controller - Vector Movement(Maybe Unity's new input system) or Rigidbody Movement + Rotation using Quaternion math

-Character Controller - An Animator you control using code (properly using StateMachineBehaviour?)

-Character Controller - Mappable Inputs (var map = new InputActionMap(); map.AddAction("action1", binding: "<Keyboard>/space");)

-Character Controller pfx running - Juice Particle systems, screen shake, blur (satisfiying)

-Third person Camera Movement - Fluid Camera Movement

-Menu item - Pause screen + functioning menu item >1 OR UI that displays info (health bar/minimap)

-Background music - 1) fade in/out 2) transition seamless to other music tracks etc

-Puzzles/Challenges - proper use of UnityEvent and UnityAction

-Puzzles/Challenges - Procedurally generated levels

-Puzzles/challenges - Resources folder to spawn or Scriptable objects

Features that are Stretch Goals:
-Portal or Load Different Scene - Proper use of Asynch scene loading (include loading bar)
-Save multiple game sessions - properly save and load a game file 
-Multiplayer Functionality


You DO need a writeup of what you are planning to do! Tell me the overall concept, and what individual components or features you plan on implementing to make that happen. 

Working by myself.
